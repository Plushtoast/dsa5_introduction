{"name":"Introduction","content":"<p>Introduction to the adventure.</p>\n<p>Read out loud to your players:</p>\n<p><em>Severin loved spending time with his mother while she crafted horseshoes on the forge. He also loved going on walks with her while she told him of the exploits of his father, a soldier in the Empress Rohaja’s Imperial army who always sent his pay and news of his adventurous deeds back home to Alriksford, Severin’s village. Severin always knew when the Beilunker Riders had brought another such letter because his mother would ask to go on a walk with him. Today was just such a day. A horseman had brought a whole bag of letters to Alriksford. Severin’s mother was very anxious when the Beilunker Rider arrived, but she soon was relieved when she broke the seal and read that her husband was well.</em></p>\n<p><em>His mother always read these letters to him by the lake, which is why Severin raced ahead now, anxious to hear the latest news from his father. Under a large oak tree, about half a mile from the lake, Severin paused and turned. He urged his mother to catch up. At first she laughed like she always did when her son acted this way, but then she suddenly froze as if she had seen the Nameless One himself. For a moment, Severin did not understand the meaning of the look on her face, but when she drew her forge hammer from her belt, he knew that they had encountered something dangerous.</em></p>\n<p><em>Severin could hear low, raspy breaths coming from somewhere behind him. Rising fear forced him to turn around, and he looked into the yellow eyes of a creature from his nightmares. The orc was larger than Severin. It had a shaggy, black pelt, and wielded a jagged saber in its right hand. Its grin revealed its lower canines, which looked like tusks, and it was not alone. Two other dark shapes stood nearby. Severin tried to run, but one of the orcs grabbed him and did not let go. The others charged at his mother, screaming their battle cries.</em></p>\n<p><em>Oh, please, Lord Ingerimm and Lady Rondra, help my mother, Severin prayed. Before he could learn his mother’s fate, the orc had swung him over its shoulder and started to run. The last things he remembered were his mother’s cries and the sounds of clashing weapons. </em></p>\n<p><em>Alriksford — a small, placid Aventurian village. The </em><em>villagers live in modest wealth, but their settlement </em><em>is not far from the Realmwood, a forest about which </em><em>many legends are told. Ghosts, faeries, and monsters </em><em>are said to live in the Realmwood and protect it from </em><em>human encroachment. Many of these tales are probably </em><em>superstition, but the Realmwood is home to many </em><em>gangs of brigands, among them the orc bandit Kurgh </em><em>Yellowtooth, who specializes in kidnapping human </em><em>children and selling them to slavers.</em></p>\n<p><em>This time he has chosen Severin Thalbach, the tenyear-</em><em>old son of the female blacksmith Gisla. Mother </em><em>and son were attacked while walking at the edge of the </em><em>Realmwood, and even though Gisla fought back, she </em><em>could not stop Kurgh’s orcs from seizing her son. Badly </em><em>wounded, Gisla managed to return to Alriksford and tell </em><em>the village mayor, Malor, about the tragedy. Malor is </em><em>desperate. He knows the orcs are dangerous and doesn’t </em><em>think anyone in the village is capable of tracking them </em><em>and rescuing young Severin. Luckily, the heroes arrived </em><em>in Alriksford and heard that Gisla’s son had been taken.</em></p>\n<p><em>Without hesitation they offer to help and go hunt the </em><em>orcs.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Time Points and Looking for the Boy</h1>\n<p>Of course, it’s a matter of honor for the heroes to rescue the boy, but they must hurry. Kurgh’s orcs carried Severin to their hideout in the forest, where they wait for their leader. The heroes have no time to waste. In some scenes of this adventure, the heroes may receive time points. If they collect 4 or more time points, Kurgh is waiting at the hideout when the heroes arrive. If they collect fewer than 4 time points, they only have to deal with Kurgh’s orcs. </p>\n<p>As Game Master (GM), you should read the scenario beforehand, but feel free to simply jump from scene to scene if you just want to give a quick impression of the game’s rules.

{"name":"The Rules of The Dark Eye RPG","content":"<p>Welcome to The Dark Eye RPG! This booklet introduces you to the setting and teaches you how to resolve skill checks, cast spells, and conduct combats – everything you need to know to start playing. As a bonus, this booklet includes an exciting introductory adventure called Slavers of the Realmwood. Let’s get started!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Skills</h1>\n<p>In The Dark Eye, heroes may choose from a wide variety of skills. Skills include proficiencies (such as Tracking and Plant Lore) and spells.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Attributes are a measure of a hero’s raw abilities. Every hero has eight attributes: Courage, Sagacity, Intuition, Charisma, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, and Strength. The higher your number, the better your hero performs with that attribute.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Skill Checks</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Every skill, spell, and skill group (Physical, Social, Nature, Knowledge, Crafts) is linked to three attributes. You roll a D20 against each of these attributes in sequence when making a skill check.</li>\n<li>Every skill in a skill group uses the same three linked attributes when making skill checks. For example, if you want to make a check for a skill in the Social skill group, you always roll against Intuition, Charisma, and Charisma, regardless of whether you are making a Seduction check or an Intimidation check.</li>\n<li>To succeed, the number you roll must be less than or equal to the linked attribute.</li>\n<li>To help achieve success with skill checks, you have a pool of skill points (SP) that you can spend to reduce rolls that are too high. The pool of SP available for each skill is equal to the skill’s skill rating (SR). Every skill and spell has its own SR. For example, if your hero has a SR of 3 and an attribute rating of 12, and you roll a 14, you can spend 2 points of the hero’s SP to reduce your roll to 12.</li>\n<li>You cannot use SP spent in this manner for any rolls that remain for that skill check. If you have SP 10 and spend 6 of those points adjusting your first attribute roll, you have only 4 SP left to reduce the remaining rolls. Note that when you spend SP, you do not lose them forever—if you must make a skill check for the same skill later during the adventure, your full SP is available once again.</li>\n<li>If you use up all of your SP and cannot reduce a roll enough to succeed, the skill check fails.</li>\n<li>If you succeed on a skill check, your remaining SP (if any) determine the skill check’s Quality Level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Quality Levels</h3>\n<p>Three points of SP equal one Quality Level (QL). The higher the QL, the better your result. For example, this could mean that you gain more information, craft a higher-quality item, or achieve longer lasting results. If you succeed with a check but have no SP left over, you still get a QL of 1.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Quality Level</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width:252px;height:112px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">Remaining SP</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">Quality Level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">0-3</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">4-6</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">7-9</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">10-12</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:125.333px;height:17px\">13-15</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px;height:17px\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:125.333px\">+16</td>\n<td style=\"width:122.667px\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Cumulative Group Checks</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, such as when cooperating to achieve certain tasks, heroes must make cumulative group checks. This means that all players make a check using the relevant skill and add all their QL together. If Player A gets a QL of 2 and Player B gets a QL of 3, together they achieve a total QL of 5 for their cumulative group check.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Combat</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Combat Round</h2>\n<p>In The Dark Eye, combats are divided into combat rounds (CR). Every combat round represents about 2–5 seconds, enough time for everyone to make an attack or perform another action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>Initiative (INI) determines the order in which combatants can act, and is calculated by adding a base value to the roll of 1D6 (this formula appears on the character sheet under INI). Initiative remains the same for an entire combat and is not rolled anew each CR. The combatant with the highest Initiative can act first. If two combatants have the same Initiative, both roll a single D6. The one with the highest result can act first. In case of another draw, continue rolling until one combatant has a higher result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n<p>In each combat round, every combatant may perform an action, one or more defenses, and one free action, as follows.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Actions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Make an attack<br />Make a ranged attack<br />Move up to your Movement in paces (yards)<br />Draw a weapon<br />Draw a ranged weapon (may cost more than one action, depending on the reload time)<br />Cast a spell (may cost more than one action, depending on the spell)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Defense</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parry<br />Dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Free Actions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shout a brief sentence<br />Drop an item<br />Drop to the ground<br />Turn around 180 degrees<br />Move up to your Movement in paces (yards)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Attack and Defense</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Roll 1D20 to see if you are successful with an attack or a defense. To succeed, your result must be equal to or less than your hero’s value in Attack, Ranged Combat, Parry, or Dodge (you can find these ratings listed under Combat Techniques or Equipment on the character sheets).</li>\n<li>To attack an opponent in close combat, roll against your Attack (AT).</li>\n<li>To use a ranged weapon, like a bow, roll against Ranged Combat (RC).</li>\n<li>If you defend, roll against your Defense Value. There are two ways to defend yourself—Parry (PA) with a melee weapon or shield, or Dodge (DO) to physically evade an attack.</li>\n<li>If an opponent’s attack succeeds, you may try to defend yourself. Ranged attacks can only be dodged or parried with a shield, but not parried with a weapon.</li>\n<li>If you are attacked more than once in a combat round, you incur a cumulative penalty of 3 for each defense you make after your first. If your defense value drops to 0 or less due to penalties, you can no longer defend during this CR. In the next CR, you may again start with your full defense value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Ranged Combat: Range and Reload Time</h3>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Ranged weapons have three range categories (RA) measured in yards and presented in the format short/medium/long (these numbers appear in parentheses along with the weapon’s stats under Equipment on the character sheets). A modifier may apply to RC depending on where the target is located. If the target is at medium range, the RC value is not modified. At short range, you get a bonus of 2 and 1 DP to your RC value. At long range, you suffer a penalty of 2 and 1 DP.</li>\n<li>Ranged weapons have a reload time (RT), measured in actions. Some projectile weapons require more than one action to reload.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Damage</p>\n<p>If an attack, ranged attack, or damaging spell succeeds,and the target’s defense fails, the target is hit. </p>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Weapons have a rating called damage points (DP). For example, 1D6+4 DP means that you roll one sixsided die and add 4 to the result to determine how much damage you inflict.</li>\n<li>Subtract the target’s Protection (PRO) from the damage.</li>\n<li>Deduct any remaining damage from the target’s Life Points (LP).</li>\n<li>When a creature’s LP drop to 0 or less, it is incapacitated and dying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Special Abilities</h1>\n<p>Combat special abilities grant new possibilities in combat. Passive combat special abilities modify stats or offer other passive bonuses and don’t require the combatant to take an action. All others are actions or maneuvers. Characters can use only one maneuver at a time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Magic</h1>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Arcane Energy</h2>\n<p>Every spell costs a certain amount of arcane energy (AE). When a character casts a spell, deduct the required number of AE from the character’s total. If the spell check fails, you must still pay half the AE cost (rounded up).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Casting Time, Range, and Duration</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Casting a spell usually takes time and requires a certain number of actions. After taking the last action needed for the spell, make your skill check.</li>\n<li>To cast a spell successfully, the target of the spell must remain within the spell’s range for the entire casting time. If the target moves outside the spell’s range during the casting attempt, the spell fails.</li>\n<li>Some spells take effect immediately, some spell effects can be sustained by spending additional AE (as noted under AE Cost in the spell listing), and some spell durations are variable based on QL (as noted under Duration in the spell listing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>All spells provided in the quick-start rules are included in the example characters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Fate Points</h1>\n<p>Fate Points Fate Points (FtP) are a measure of a hero’s luck and the influence of the gods. FtP represent that little bit of extra luck that separates heroes from everyone else.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How Can I Spend Fate Points?</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li><em>Reroll</em>: you can spend one FtP to reroll one, two, or all three dice for a skill check or an Attack, Defense, or Ranged Combat roll.

If your weapon inflicts more than 1D6 damage, you can still only reroll one D6, not more.</li>\n<li><em>Defense</em>: To strengthen your defense in combat, you can spend one FtP to receive a bonus of 4 to all defense checks you make until the end of the CR. You can spend this FtP at any time in the CR, but must do so before you roll the defense you wish to strengthen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Note on Fate Points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>To increase the challenge for your players in the adventure Slavers of the Realmwood, start all characters with 1 fate point less.

{"name":"An Overview of Aventuria","content":"<p>The heart of Aventuria is the Middenrealm, an empire nominally ruled by the young Empress Rohaja but in reality controlled by powerful regional lords and ladies. The land is home to daring knights and other heroes who fight for the order of the gods, as well as grim dwarves who have delved their mines and subterranean cities deep in the mountains. The capital of the realm is Gareth, the largest city on the continent. Gareth alone holds the potential for hundreds of dangerous and exciting adventures.</p>\n<p>The orcs of Aventuria make their home in the Orclands, steppes that sit on the northwestern border of the Middenrealm. Called “coal pelts” by humans due to their heavy black fur, the orcs wage eternal war on their neighbors. They are usually thought to be barbaric, cruel, and willing to test their strength against anyone stupid enough to challenge them.</p>\n<p>Thorwal lies west of the Orclands. The Thorwalers are brave seafarers who enjoy a reputation as feared pirates. Emboldened by their whale-god, Swafnir, their longboats threaten much of the western coast of Aventuria.</p>\n<p>South of the Middenrealm, the progressive Horasian Empire is home to artists and poets. The cities of this fertile land are ruled by patricians, nobles, and councilors who strive constantly to outdo their rivals or weaken them via intrigue. The ruler of the realm is called the Horas, a man who, as the son of a dragon, governs with uncanny foresight.</p>\n<p>In the south lies the Empire of Al’Anfa. Its capital of the same name, called the Boil of the South by some, is a city of decadence and intrigue, and a stranger’s life is worth only what it can fetch in the slave markets. The sprawling metropolis is kept alive by farms and groves where slaves toil endlessly to increase their owners’ wealth.</p>\n<p>The jungles of the Far South and the Forest Islands are home to the Forest Folk and the Utulus, whose daily struggles for survival include facing threats from Al’Anfan manhunters and other slavers.</p>\n<p>Beyond the mountains east of the Horasian Empire, Novadi tribes rule the huge Khôm Desert. Many caravans fall victim to the unforgiving sands and the nomadic warriors of the Caliphate. The monotheistic Novadi worship Rastullah and sneer at outsiders, whom they consider ignorant heathens with their many gods.</p>\n<p>Even further east are the Lands of the Tulamydes, which are ruled by sultans and emirs. This region’s many small citystates are famous for their djinn summoners, wily thieves, and bazaars filled with exotic goods.</p>\n<p>The Shadowlands, a former province of the Middenrealm, was conquered some years ago by demon summoners and necromancers, the human servants of powerful archdemons. Here unscrupulous nobles pursue their own agendas, unfettered by either human or divine law.</p>\n<p>The northern forests and steppes surrounding the Salamander Stones are the traditional homelands of the elves. Orcs and humans avoid these mountains and woodlands, as the elves do not like strangers who trespass upon their land. Elves are beloved for their beauty and grace but feared for their sometimes cruel treatment of invaders. They are magical beings who seem to be born from light, and their lives, which are said to last forever, are filled with music and song.</p>\n<p>North of Bornland lies an expanse of tundra, snow, and ice known as the High North. The Nivese wander the steppes with their herds of animals, and the Norbards journey from village to village to peddle their wares, but both keep to the warmer areas. Few people live in the ice deserts, though trappers and prospectors sometimes travel there in search of ancient secrets. Only yeti, dark elves, and the Fjarningers, a barbaric tribe of humans, dare to live out on the eternal ice.</p>","img":"modules/dsa5-introduction/icons/maps/image.png","folder":"jzyUTorybGFPH07k","sort":300001,"permission":{"default":0,"veCE8dqHRCDtbCQH":3,"ZtfWoXOb55858Ryr":3},"flags":{"dsa5":{"parent":"Rules","sort":300001,"initId":"nsUUQi3pISNZDDvd"}},"_id":"ohvRM0TVu9VkY6Sf"}

{"name":"Quick-Start","content":"<p>Welcome to the thrilling world of The Dark Eye! Heroic adventure awaits you in the fantasy setting of Aventuria. This guide explains the basic concepts of the game, and the introductory scenario and pre-generated characters allow you and your friends to start playing right away!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>What Do You Need to Play The Dark Eye?</h1>\n<p>To take your first step into Aventuria, you need only the following.</p>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>This quick-start guide</li>\n<li>Some twenty-sided (D20) and six-sided (D6) dice</li>\n<li>Pencils and paper for taking notes</li>\n<li>Somebody to act as the Game Master (GM), plus three to five players that take the roles of heroes</li>\n<li>Two to three hours of time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following pages briefly introduce you to Aventuria and explain the game’s most important rules, such as how to make skill checks, fight opponents, and cast spells (if you’d prefer to skip ahead to the rules, see page 6).</p>\n<p>This booklet includes a short introductory scenario called Slavers of the Realmwood (see page 10) and six ready-to-play characters (see page 15) to get you started playing right away. Your players may choose from among the following heroes: the brave mercenary Geron, the dexterous elven ranger Layariel, the daring dwarven warrior Arbosh, the cunning mage Mirhiban, the charming half elf rogue Carolan, and the intimidating sea-raider Tjalva.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>What is a Roleplaying Game?</h1>\n<p>The Dark Eye is a fantasy roleplaying game that allows you and your friends to experience a world of adventure. Players take the roles of characters participating in an ongoing story. Imagine the game like a TV series where you and the other players decide where to go and what to do. Your decisions influence the course of the story, and nobody can predict how it will end.</p>\n<p>The players’ characters (the heroes) explore the setting and face challenges together. One participant acts as the Game Master (GM), who describes the world’s personalities and dangers.</p>\n<p>Player goals in a roleplaying game differ from most traditional games in that all players (including the GM) cooperate to play together, not against each other. As a group, they try to overcome challenges such as solving riddles, defeating enemies, and rescuing the count’s son, creating the story together. Enjoying adventures, having fun acting out your characters, and facing countless challenges are the true goals of role playing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>GM and Players</h1>\n<p>The roles of GM and player differ greatly. Players take the role of player characters (PCs), which are created using the guidelines presented in the TDE Core Rules. Players announce their characters’ actions, roll dice when an important action’s outcome is uncertain, and keep track of their characters’ stats, equipment, and achievements. Player characters are sometimes also called heroes or adventurers.</p>\n<p>The GM describes the game setting, portrays all characters that are not portrayed by the players, creates exciting adventures for the heroes, and acts as a referee. Characters portrayed by the GM are called non-player characters (NPCs). Collectively, a gaming group is a group of players and a GM who meet for a game session.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>What is a Dark Eye?</h1>\n<p>The game derives its name from the most intriguing magical artifacts in Aventuria—the Dark Eyes. These rare and powerful magical items allow users to view far away places and glimpse scenes from the distant past. Creating such an artifact calls for very powerful magic and a sizable quantity of raw meteoritic iron. Few spellcasters have ever mastered the necessary enchantments. When completed successfully, the iron assumes the form of an orb or sometimes an eye, hence the artifact’s name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>What is Aventuria?</h1>\n<p>Adventures in The Dark Eye primarily take place in Aventuria, a continent with features ranging from the southern jungles and swamps ruled by lizard people, mountain kingdoms of the dwarves, the steppes of the orcs, the forests of the elves, and the icy northern lands of the Fjarninger barbarians. Aventuria offers challenges and dangers for every kind of hero, from questing knight to powerful archmage.</p>","folder":"jzyUTorybGFPH07k","sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"veCE8dqHRCDtbCQH":3,"ZtfWoXOb55858Ryr":3},"flags":{"dsa5":{"parent":"Rules","sort":100001,"initId":"iKBep6lJx8qULvqH"}},"_id":"vDM641I1PzeKenKu"}
