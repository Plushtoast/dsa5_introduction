Your players may choose&nbsp;from among the following heroes: the brave mercenary&nbsp;Geron, the dexterous elven ranger Layariel, the daring&nbsp;dwarven warrior Arbosh, the cunning mage Mirhiban,&nbsp;the charming half elf rogue Carolan, and the intimidating&nbsp;sea-raider Tjalva.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>What is a&nbsp;Roleplaying Game?</h1>\n<p>The Dark Eye is a fantasy roleplaying game that&nbsp;allows you and your friends to experience a world&nbsp;of adventure. Players take the roles of characters&nbsp;participating in an ongoing story. Imagine the game&nbsp;like a TV series where you and the other players&nbsp;decide where to go and what to do. Your decisions&nbsp;influence the course of the story, and nobody can&nbsp;predict how it will end.</p>\n<p>The players&rsquo; characters (the heroes) explore the&nbsp;setting and face challenges together. One participant&nbsp;acts as the Game Master (GM), who describes the&nbsp;world&rsquo;s personalities and dangers.</p>\n<p>Player goals in a roleplaying game differ from most&nbsp;traditional games in that all players (including the GM)&nbsp;cooperate to play together, not against each other.&nbsp;As a group, they try to overcome challenges such as&nbsp;solving riddles, defeating enemies, and rescuing the&nbsp;count&rsquo;s son, creating the story together. Enjoying&nbsp;adventures, having fun acting out your characters,&nbsp;and facing countless challenges are the true goals of&nbsp;role playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>GM and Players</h1>\n<p>The roles of GM and player differ greatly. Players&nbsp;take the role of player characters (PCs), which are&nbsp;created using the guidelines presented in the TDE Core&nbsp;Rules. Players announce their characters&rsquo; actions, roll&nbsp;dice when an important action&rsquo;s outcome is uncertain,&nbsp;and keep track of their characters&rsquo; stats, equipment,&nbsp;and achievements. Player characters are sometimes&nbsp;also called heroes or adventurers.</p>\n<p>The GM describes the game setting, portrays all&nbsp;characters that are not portrayed by the players,&nbsp;creates exciting adventures for the heroes, and acts as&nbsp;a referee. Characters portrayed by the GM are called&nbsp;non-player characters (NPCs). Collectively, a gaming&nbsp;group is a group of players and a GM who meet for a&nbsp;game session.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>What is a Dark Eye?</h1>\n<p>The game derives its name from the most intriguing&nbsp;magical artifacts in Aventuria&mdash;the Dark Eyes. These&nbsp;rare and powerful magical items allow users to view&nbsp;far away places and glimpse scenes from the distant&nbsp;past. Creating such an artifact calls for very powerful&nbsp;magic and a sizable quantity of raw meteoritic iron.&nbsp;Few spellcasters have ever mastered the necessary&nbsp;enchantments. When completed successfully, the&nbsp;iron assumes the form of an orb or sometimes an eye,&nbsp;hence the artifact&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>What is Aventuria?</h1>\n<p>Adventures in The Dark Eye primarily take place in&nbsp;Aventuria, a continent with features ranging from the&nbsp;southern jungles and swamps ruled by lizard people, mountain kingdoms of the dwarves, the steppes of&nbsp;the orcs, the forests of the elves, and the icy northern&nbsp;lands of the Fjarninger barbarians. Aventuria offers&nbsp;challenges and dangers for every kind of hero, from&nbsp;questing knight to powerful archmage.</p>","_id":"3d1Mk2a2sNxESN1f"}

{"name":"The Rules of The Dark Eye RPG","permission":{"default":0,"ZtfWoXOb55858Ryr":3},"flags":{"dsa5":{"parent":"Rules","sort":200001}},"content":"<p>Welcome to The Dark Eye RPG! This booklet introduces&nbsp;you to the setting and teaches you how to resolve skill&nbsp;checks, cast spells, and conduct combats &ndash; everything&nbsp;you need to know to start playing. As a bonus, this&nbsp;booklet includes an exciting introductory adventure&nbsp;called Slavers of the Realmwood. Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Skills</h1>\n<p>In The Dark Eye, heroes may choose from a wide variety&nbsp;of skills. Skills include proficiencies (such as Tracking&nbsp;and Plant Lore) and spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attributes</h2>\n<p>Attributes are a measure of a hero&rsquo;s raw abilities. Every&nbsp;hero has eight attributes: Courage, Sagacity, Intuition,&nbsp;Charisma, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, and Strength.&nbsp;The higher your number, the better your hero performs&nbsp;with that attribute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Checks</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Every skill, spell, and skill group (Physical, Social,&nbsp;Nature, Knowledge, Crafts) is linked to three attributes.&nbsp;You roll a D20 against each of these attributes in&nbsp;sequence when making a skill check.</li>\n<li>Every skill in a skill group uses the same three linked&nbsp;attributes when making skill checks. For example, if&nbsp;you want to make a check for a skill in the Social skill&nbsp;group, you always roll against Intuition, Charisma,&nbsp;and Charisma, regardless of whether you are making a&nbsp;Seduction check or an Intimidation check.</li>\n<li>To succeed, the number you roll must be less than&nbsp;or equal to the linked attribute.</li>\n<li>To help achieve success with skill checks, you have&nbsp;a pool of skill points (SP) that you can spend to reduce&nbsp;rolls that are too high. The pool of SP available for each&nbsp;skill is equal to the skill&rsquo;s skill rating (SR). Every skill and&nbsp;spell has its own SR. For example, if your hero has a SR of&nbsp;3 and an attribute rating of 12, and you roll a 14, you can&nbsp;spend 2 points of the hero&rsquo;s SP to reduce your roll to 12.</li>\n<li>You cannot use SP spent in this manner for any&nbsp;rolls that remain for that skill check. If you have SP 10&nbsp;and spend 6 of those points adjusting your first attribute&nbsp;roll, you have only 4 SP left to reduce the remaining&nbsp;rolls. Note that when you spend SP, you do not lose them&nbsp;forever&mdash;if you must make a skill check for the same skill&nbsp;later during the adventure, your full SP is available once&nbsp;again.</li>\n<li>If you use up all of your SP and cannot reduce a roll&nbsp;enough to succeed, the skill check fails.</li>\n<li>If you succeed on a skill check, your remaining SP&nbsp;(if any) determine the skill check&rsquo;s Quality Level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Quality Levels</h3>\n<p>Three points of SP equal one Quality Level (QL). The&nbsp;higher the QL, the better your result. For example, this&nbsp;could mean that you gain more information, craft a&nbsp;higher-quality item, or achieve longer lasting results. If&nbsp;you succeed with a check but have no SP left over, you&nbsp;still get a QL of 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Quality Level</strong></p>\n<table style=\"width: 252px; height: 112px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">Remaining SP</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">Quality Level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">0-3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">4-6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">7-9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">10-12</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px; height: 17px;\">13-15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px; height: 17px;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 125.333px;\">+16</td>\n<td style=\"width: 122.667px;\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cumulative Group Checks</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, such as when cooperating to achieve&nbsp;certain tasks, heroes must make cumulative group checks.&nbsp;This means that all players make a check using the&nbsp;relevant skill and add all their QL together. If Player A&nbsp;gets a QL of 2 and Player B gets a QL of 3, together they&nbsp;achieve a total QL of 5 for their cumulative group check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Combat</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat Round</h2>\n<p>In The Dark Eye, combats are divided into combat&nbsp;rounds (CR). Every combat round represents about 2&ndash;5&nbsp;seconds, enough time for everyone to make an attack or&nbsp;perform another action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>Initiative (INI) determines the order in which combatants&nbsp;can act, and is calculated by adding a base value to the roll&nbsp;of 1D6 (this formula appears on the character sheet under&nbsp;INI). Initiative remains the same for an entire combat&nbsp;and is not rolled anew each CR. The combatant with the&nbsp;highest Initiative can act first. If two combatants have&nbsp;the same Initiative, both roll a single D6. The one with&nbsp;the highest result can act first. In case of another draw,&nbsp;continue rolling until one combatant has a higher result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Actions</h2>\n<p>In each combat round, every combatant may perform&nbsp;an action, one or more defenses, and one free action, as&nbsp;follows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Actions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Make an attack<br />Make a ranged attack<br />Move up to your Movement in paces (yards)<br />Draw a weapon<br />Draw a ranged weapon (may cost more than one action, depending on the reload time)<br />Cast a spell (may cost more than one action, depending on the spell)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Defense</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parry<br />Dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Free Actions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shout a brief sentence<br />Drop an item<br />Drop to the ground<br />Turn around 180 degrees<br />Move up to your Movement in paces (yards)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attack and Defense</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Roll 1D20 to see if you are successful with an&nbsp;attack or a defense. To succeed, your result must&nbsp;be equal to or less than your hero&rsquo;s value in Attack,&nbsp;Ranged Combat, Parry, or Dodge (you can find these&nbsp;ratings listed under Combat Techniques or Equipment on&nbsp;the character sheets).</li>\n<li>To attack an opponent in close combat, roll against&nbsp;your Attack (AT).</li>\n<li>To use a ranged weapon, like a bow, roll against&nbsp;Ranged Combat (RC).</li>\n<li>If you defend, roll against your Defense Value. There&nbsp;are two ways to defend yourself&mdash;Parry (PA) with a melee&nbsp;weapon or shield, or Dodge (DO) to physically evade an attack.</li>\n<li>If an opponent&rsquo;s attack succeeds, you may try to&nbsp;defend yourself. Ranged attacks can only be dodged or&nbsp;parried with a shield, but not parried with a weapon.</li>\n<li>If you are attacked more than once in a combat&nbsp;round, you incur a cumulative penalty of 3 for each&nbsp;defense you make after your first. If your defense value&nbsp;drops to 0 or less due to penalties, you can no longer&nbsp;defend during this CR. In the next CR, you may again&nbsp;start with your full defense value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Ranged Combat: Range and Reload Time</h3>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Ranged weapons have three range categories (RA)&nbsp;measured in yards and presented in the format short/medium/long (these numbers appear in parentheses along&nbsp;with the weapon&rsquo;s stats under Equipment on the character&nbsp;sheets). A modifier may apply to RC depending on where&nbsp;the target is located. If the target is at medium range, the&nbsp;RC value is not modified. At short range, you get a bonus&nbsp;of 2 and 1 DP to your RC value. At long range, you suffer a&nbsp;penalty of 2 and 1 DP.</li>\n<li>Ranged weapons have a reload time (RT), measured&nbsp;in actions. Some projectile weapons require more than&nbsp;one action to reload.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Damage</p>\n<p>If an attack, ranged attack, or damaging spell succeeds,and the target&rsquo;s defense fails, the target is hit.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Weapons have a rating called damage points (DP).&nbsp;For example, 1D6+4 DP means that you roll one sixsided&nbsp;die and add 4 to the result to determine how much&nbsp;damage you inflict.</li>\n<li>Subtract the target&rsquo;s Protection (PRO) from the&nbsp;damage.</li>\n<li>Deduct any remaining damage from the target&rsquo;s&nbsp;Life Points (LP).</li>\n<li>When a creature&rsquo;s LP drop to 0 or less, it is&nbsp;incapacitated and dying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Special Abilities</h1>\n<p>Combat special abilities grant new possibilities in combat.&nbsp;Passive combat special abilities modify stats or offer other&nbsp;passive bonuses and don&rsquo;t require the combatant to take&nbsp;an action. All others are actions or maneuvers. Characters&nbsp;can use only one maneuver at a time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Magic</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arcane Energy</h2>\n<p>Every spell costs a certain amount of arcane energy&nbsp;(AE). When a character casts a spell, deduct the required&nbsp;number of AE from the character&rsquo;s total. If the spell check&nbsp;fails, you must still pay half the AE cost (rounded up).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting Time, Range, and&nbsp;Duration</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li>Casting a spell usually takes time and requires a&nbsp;certain number of actions. After taking the last action&nbsp;needed for the spell, make your skill check.</li>\n<li>To cast a spell successfully, the target of the spell&nbsp;must remain within the spell&rsquo;s range for the entire&nbsp;casting time. If the target moves outside the spell&rsquo;s&nbsp;range during the casting attempt, the spell fails.</li>\n<li>Some spells take effect immediately, some spell&nbsp;effects can be sustained by spending additional AE (as&nbsp;noted under AE Cost in the spell listing), and some spell&nbsp;durations are variable based on QL (as noted under&nbsp;Duration in the spell listing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>All spells provided in the quick-start rules are included in the example characters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Fate Points</h1>\n<p>Fate Points Fate Points (FtP) are a measure of a hero&rsquo;s luck and&nbsp;the influence of the gods. FtP represent that little bit of&nbsp;extra luck that separates heroes from everyone else.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How Can I Spend Fate Points?</h2>\n<ul class=\"dsalist\">\n<li><em>Reroll</em>: you can spend one FtP to reroll one, two, or&nbsp;all three dice for a skill check or an Attack, Defense, or&nbsp;Ranged Combat roll. The second roll counts. Whether&nbsp;you need to reroll one, two, or all three dice of a check,&nbsp;you still spend just one FtP. You can spend only one FtP&nbsp;per check this way. You can choose that option after a&nbsp;fully completed roll, so that&nbsp;you can determine if you&nbsp;have rolled a fumble.</li>\n<li><em>Reroll Damage</em>: By&nbsp;spending one FtP, you&nbsp;can reroll 1D6 of damage.&nbsp;You may only reroll your&nbsp;damage roll, not your&nbsp;opponent&rsquo;s roll. If your&nbsp;weapon inflicts more than&nbsp;1D6 damage, you can still&nbsp;only reroll one D6, not&nbsp;more.</li>\n<li><em>Defense</em>: To strengthen&nbsp;your defense in combat,&nbsp;you can spend one FtP to&nbsp;receive a bonus of 4 to all&nbsp;defense checks you make&nbsp;until the end of the CR. You&nbsp;can spend this FtP at any time in the CR, but must do so&nbsp;before you roll the defense you wish to strengthen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Note on Fate Points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>To increase the challenge for your players in the adventure Slavers of the Realmwood, start all characters with 1 fate point less.

He also loved going on walks&nbsp;with her while she told him of the exploits of his father, a&nbsp;soldier in the Empress Rohaja&rsquo;s Imperial army who always&nbsp;sent his pay and news of his adventurous deeds back home&nbsp;to Alriksford, Severin&rsquo;s village. Severin always knew when the&nbsp;Beilunker Riders had brought another such letter because his&nbsp;mother would ask to go on a walk with him. Today was just&nbsp;such a day. A horseman had brought a whole bag of letters&nbsp;to Alriksford. Severin&rsquo;s mother was very anxious when the&nbsp;Beilunker Rider arrived, but she soon was relieved when she&nbsp;broke the seal and read that her husband was well.</em></p>\n<p><em>His mother always read these letters to him by the lake,&nbsp;which is why Severin raced ahead now, anxious to hear the&nbsp;latest news from his father. Under a large oak tree, about half&nbsp;a mile from the lake, Severin paused and turned. He urged his&nbsp;mother to catch up. At first she laughed like she always did&nbsp;when her son acted this way, but then she suddenly froze as if&nbsp;she had seen the Nameless One himself. For a moment, Severin&nbsp;did not understand the meaning of the look on her face, but&nbsp;when she drew her forge hammer from her belt, he knew that&nbsp;they had encountered something dangerous.</em></p>\n<p><em>Severin could hear low, raspy breaths coming from&nbsp;somewhere behind him. Rising fear forced him to turn around,&nbsp;and he looked into the yellow eyes of a creature from his&nbsp;nightmares. The orc was larger than Severin. It had a shaggy,&nbsp;black pelt, and wielded a jagged saber in its right hand. Its grin&nbsp;revealed its lower canines, which looked like tusks, and it was&nbsp;not alone. Two other dark shapes stood nearby. Severin tried&nbsp;to run, but one of the orcs grabbed him and did not let go. The&nbsp;others charged at his mother, screaming their battle cries.</em></p>\n<p><em>Oh, please, Lord Ingerimm and Lady Rondra, help my&nbsp;mother, Severin prayed. Before he could learn his mother&rsquo;s&nbsp;fate, the orc had swung him over its shoulder and started to&nbsp;run. The last things he remembered were his mother&rsquo;s cries&nbsp;and the sounds of clashing weapons.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Alriksford &mdash; a small, placid Aventurian village. The&nbsp;</em><em>villagers live in modest wealth, but their settlement&nbsp;</em><em>is not far from the Realmwood, a forest about which&nbsp;</em><em>many legends are told. Ghosts, faeries, and monsters&nbsp;</em><em>are said to live in the Realmwood and protect it from&nbsp;</em><em>human encroachment. Many of these tales are probably&nbsp;</em><em>superstition, but the Realmwood is home to many&nbsp;</em><em>gangs of brigands, among them the orc bandit Kurgh&nbsp;</em><em>Yellowtooth, who specializes in kidnapping human&nbsp;</em><em>children and selling them to slavers.</em></p>\n<p><em>This time he has chosen Severin Thalbach, the tenyear-</em><em>old son of the female blacksmith Gisla. Mother&nbsp;</em><em>and son were attacked while walking at the edge of the&nbsp;</em><em>Realmwood, and even though Gisla fought back, she&nbsp;</em><em>could not stop Kurgh&rsquo;s orcs from seizing her son. Badly&nbsp;</em><em>wounded, Gisla managed to return to Alriksford and tell&nbsp;</em><em>the village mayor, Malor, about the tragedy. Malor is&nbsp;</em><em>desperate. He knows the orcs are dangerous and doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</em><em>think anyone in the village is capable of tracking them&nbsp;</em><em>and rescuing young Severin. Luckily, the heroes arrived&nbsp;</em><em>in Alriksford and heard that Gisla&rsquo;s son had been taken.</em></p>\n<p><em>Without hesitation they offer to help and go hunt the&nbsp;</em><em>orcs.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Time Points and&nbsp;Looking for the Boy</h1>\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a matter of honor for the heroes to rescue&nbsp;the boy, but they must hurry. Kurgh&rsquo;s orcs carried Severin&nbsp;to their hideout in the forest, where they wait for their&nbsp;leader. The heroes have no time to waste. In some scenes&nbsp;of this adventure, the heroes may receive time points. If&nbsp;they collect 4 or more time points, Kurgh is waiting at the&nbsp;hideout when the heroes arrive. If they collect fewer than&nbsp;4 time points, they only have to deal with Kurgh&rsquo;s orcs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As Game Master (GM), you should read the scenario&nbsp;beforehand, but feel free to simply jump from scene to&nbsp;scene if you just want to give a quick impression of the&nbsp;game&rsquo;s rules.

{"name":"An Overview of Aventuria","permission":{"default":0,"ZtfWoXOb55858Ryr":3},"flags":{"dsa5":{"parent":"Rules","sort":300001}},"content":"<p>The heart of Aventuria is the Middenrealm, an empire&nbsp;nominally ruled by the young Empress Rohaja but in reality&nbsp;controlled by powerful regional lords and ladies. The land is&nbsp;home to daring knights and other heroes who fight for the&nbsp;order of the gods, as well as grim dwarves who have delved&nbsp;their mines and subterranean cities deep in the mountains. The&nbsp;capital of the realm is Gareth, the largest city on the continent.&nbsp;Gareth alone holds the potential for hundreds of dangerous&nbsp;and exciting adventures.</p>\n<p>The orcs of Aventuria make their home in the Orclands, steppes&nbsp;that sit on the northwestern border of the Middenrealm. Called&nbsp;&ldquo;coal pelts&rdquo; by humans due to their heavy black fur, the orcs&nbsp;wage eternal war on their neighbors. They are usually thought&nbsp;to be barbaric, cruel, and willing to test their strength against&nbsp;anyone stupid enough to challenge them.</p>\n<p>Thorwal lies west of the Orclands. The Thorwalers are brave&nbsp;seafarers who enjoy a reputation as feared pirates. Emboldened&nbsp;by their whale-god, Swafnir, their longboats threaten much of&nbsp;the western coast of Aventuria.</p>\n<p>South of the Middenrealm, the progressive Horasian Empire is&nbsp;home to artists and poets. The cities of this fertile land are ruled&nbsp;by patricians, nobles, and councilors who strive constantly to&nbsp;outdo their rivals or weaken them via intrigue. The ruler of the&nbsp;realm is called the Horas, a man who, as the son of a dragon,&nbsp;governs with uncanny foresight.</p>\n<p>In the south lies the Empire of Al&rsquo;Anfa. Its capital of the&nbsp;same name, called the Boil of the South by some, is a city of&nbsp;decadence and intrigue, and a stranger&rsquo;s life is worth only what&nbsp;it can fetch in the slave markets. The sprawling metropolis is&nbsp;kept alive by farms and groves where slaves toil endlessly to&nbsp;increase their owners&rsquo; wealth.</p>\n<p>The jungles of the Far South and the Forest Islands are home&nbsp;to the Forest Folk and the Utulus, whose daily struggles for&nbsp;survival include facing threats from Al&rsquo;Anfan manhunters and&nbsp;other slavers.</p>\n<p>Beyond the mountains east of the Horasian Empire, Novadi&nbsp;tribes rule the huge Kh&ocirc;m Desert. Many caravans fall victim&nbsp;to the unforgiving sands and the nomadic warriors of the&nbsp;Caliphate. The monotheistic Novadi worship Rastullah and&nbsp;sneer at outsiders, whom they consider ignorant heathens&nbsp;with their many gods.</p>\n<p>Even further east are the Lands of the Tulamydes, which&nbsp;are ruled by sultans and emirs. This region&rsquo;s many small citystates&nbsp;are famous for their djinn summoners, wily thieves, and&nbsp;bazaars filled with exotic goods.</p>\n<p>The Shadowlands, a former province of the Middenrealm,&nbsp;was conquered some years ago by demon summoners and&nbsp;necromancers, the human servants of powerful archdemons.&nbsp;Here unscrupulous nobles pursue their own agendas,&nbsp;unfettered by either human or divine law.</p>\n<p>The northern forests and steppes surrounding the Salamander&nbsp;Stones are the traditional homelands of the elves. Orcs and&nbsp;humans avoid these mountains and woodlands, as the elves&nbsp;do not like strangers who trespass upon their land. Elves&nbsp;are beloved for their beauty and grace but feared for their&nbsp;sometimes cruel treatment of invaders. They are magical&nbsp;beings who seem to be born from light, and their lives, which&nbsp;are said to last forever, are filled with music and song.</p>\n<p>North of Bornland lies an expanse of tundra, snow, and ice&nbsp;known as the High North. The Nivese wander the steppes&nbsp;with their herds of animals, and the Norbards journey from&nbsp;village to village to peddle their wares, but both keep to the&nbsp;warmer areas. Few people live in the ice deserts, though&nbsp;trappers and prospectors sometimes travel there in search of&nbsp;ancient secrets. Only yeti, dark elves, and the Fjarningers, a&nbsp;barbaric tribe of humans, dare to live out on the eternal ice.</p>","img":"modules/dsa5-introduction/icons/maps/image.png","_id":"tvuP4p2jW84CuwWP"}
